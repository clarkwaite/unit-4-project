The first is to discover bands similar to their favorite bands. This is accomplished by searching for an artist, and then going to the Related Artist page for that artist. Once there the user will see the related artists, a link to that artists's Spotify page, and a similarity percentage

The second is to see artists tour dates, and to easily see if their favorite artists are coming to a location near them. From the events page you can search an artists name to see their tour dates. But the most important feature is when you create a user profile you enter your home state. When you favorite an artist their concerts in that home state are displated on the home screen. This way you can login and always know if a favorite band is on tour.
